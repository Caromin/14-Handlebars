# 14-Handlebars

Please note that due to clearDB, there are connection lost issues when used through the heroku website, did provide an image with url link as proof it does work.

Edit: As of now, connection lost error is fixed, this is thanks due to mysql.createPool for passing a unsured or new connection and releasing connections due to erorrs. see connections.js for solution, provided from https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql/issues/464
